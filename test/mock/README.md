# Mock Game Data

This directory contains mock game data to test openblack without the original
game data.

This game data is auto generated via cmake, apps and python scripts and is meant for testing only.
It is in no way associated with the original game data which comes from a legally purchased copy of Black & White.

To use this data, build the cmake target `generate-mock-game-data` and give the generated path as the game data location.
